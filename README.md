# Inkdocs

Inkdocs is a static site generator made in bun, primarily built for documentation. It's goals are to be:

- Customizable - Don't just be another docusaurus site. Make your docs your own.
- Transparent - No black boxes hiding logic here. Inkdocs tries to be more of a library for compiling markdown
- Easy - Just focus on your documentation. If all you need is text on the internet, inkdocs can do that.

Inkdocs is currently in very early stages of development and shouldn't be used for production applications yet. If you're interested in helping contribute contact @firesquid6 on discord.
