# Inkdocs

Inkdocs is a static site generator made in bun, primarily built for documentation. It's goals are to be:

- Customizable - Don't just be another docusaurus site. Make your docs your own.
- Transparent - No black boxes hiding logic here. Inkdocs tries to be more of a library for compiling markdown
- Easy - Just focus on your documentation. If all you need is text on the internet, inkdocs can do that.

Inkdocs is still in the experimental stages of development.
