Inkdocs is deployed using docker
# Getting Docker Working

The default template comes prebuilt with a dockerfile. You shouldn't need to edit the Dockerfile at all. It is built off of [elysia's dockerfile](https://elysiajs.com/integrations/docker)
# Deploying to fly.io
See [fly.io's docs](https://fly.io/docs/) for this. You'll just need to create and account and run a couple commands.
