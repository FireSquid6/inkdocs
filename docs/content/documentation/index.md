# What is Inkdocs?

Inkdocs is an incredibly fast static site builder specifically geared towards building documentation sites (although it can be used for more!) just like [docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) or [starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/).

It is:

- easy to get up and running if you just need content on the internet
- easy to customize to create a hand-crafted user experience
- incredibly fast
- deployable through docker
