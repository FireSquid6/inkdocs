# With a Template

`create-inkdocs` is currently being worked on. Check back here later when it is completed!

# Manual Setup

First, create a new bun project (Inkdocs will not work with other js runtimes). It's assumed that you will be using typescript.

```bash
bun init
```

Next, install inkdocs:

```bash
bun add inkdocs
```
